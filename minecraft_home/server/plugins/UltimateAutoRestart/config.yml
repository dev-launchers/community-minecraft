# Notes:
# 1. All of the restarts must follow this specific format: "DAY;HOUR;MINUTE". e.g "Friday;23;00" will create an entry to have a restart on Fridays at 23:00 or 11PM.
# 1a. Valid day entries are: Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , Saturday , Sunday
#
# 2. messageAtInterval entries are in seconds, 1800 seconds = 30 minutes, 600 seconds = 10 minutes, 60 seconds = 1 minute etc. Same goes for soundAtIntervals.
#
# 3. If you want to execute bungee commands make sure to add [bungee] in-front of the command.
# 3a. EXAMPLE USAGE OF USING A BUNGEE COMMAND (e.g Sending all skyblock players to the lobby):
# 3a: EXAMPLE COMMAND: '[bungee] send skyblock lobby'
# 3a: GENERAL FORMAT OF THE ABOVE EXAMPLE: '[bungee] send <CURRENT SERVER NAME> <SERVER TO SEND PLAYERS TO>'
# 3a: NOTE: You must specifically use the current server's name, using "current" will not work because the command is executed via bungee.
#
# 4: You can create timed commands that will execute x seconds before the restart.
# 4a. GENERAL FORMAT OF A TIMED COMMAND: '[time:<INTERVAL>] <COMMAND>' (e.g '[time:10] time set day', will set the time to day 10 seconds before the restart).
#
# 5: You can create timed bungee commands that will execute x seconds before the restart.
# 5a. GENERAL FORMAT OF A TIMED BUNGEE COMMAND: '[bungee:<INTERVAL>] <COMMAND>' (e.g '[bungee:10] send skyblock lobby', will send all skyblock players to the lobby 10 seconds before the restart).
#
# 6: commandsAfterReboot can only be timed bukkit/bungee commands.

# delayRestart Notes:
# 1. Enabling this sytem will check <configurable time> seconds before restart if there are <x> players online, if there are it'll delay the restart by <configurable time> seconds.
# 2. minimumPlayers: 10 ---> This means that if there are 10 or more players online it'll delay the restart.
# 3. MAKE SURE THAT YOUR checkSecondsBeforeRestart AND delaybySeconds VALUES DO NOT INTERFERE WITH restartCommands ENTRIES!
# 4. informUsersWithPermission ---> Whether or not to send a message to users with "uar.notifydelay" that a delay happened.

# Do not change this if you don't know what you're doing.
# Changing this will require you to modify timed commands, messages and sounds with values that are of the seconds (from ticks) multiplier. Example: intervalTicks = 40, will force you to use multipliers of 2 only.
# Example: Changing this to 200 will make the interval go down by 10 every 10 seconds (instead of 1 every 1 second).
